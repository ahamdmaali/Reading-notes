# Introduction
● Those who want to learn how to design and build websites
from scratch
● Anyone who has a website (that may be built using a
content management system, blogging software, or an
e-commerce platform) and wants more control over the
appearance of their pages
The only things you need in order to use this book are a
computer with a web browser and a text editor (such as
Notepad, which comes with Windows, or TextEdit, which
comes with Macs).

# Structure
Many web pages act like electronic versions of these
documents. For example, newspapers show the same stories
in print as they do on websites; you can apply for insurance
over the web; and stores have online catalogs and e-commerce
facilities.
In all kinds of documents, structure is very important in helping
readers to understand the messages you are trying to convey
and to navigate around the document. So, in order to learn how
to write web pages, it is very important to understand how to
structure documents. In this chapter you will:
● See how HTML describes the structure of a web page
● Learn how tags or elements are added to your document
● Write your first web page
## How Pages Use Structure ?
Think about the stories you
read in a newspaper: for each
story, there will be a headline,
some text, and possibly some
images. If the article is a long
piece, there may be subheadings
that split the story into separate
sections or quotes from those
involved. Structure helps readers
understand the stories in the
newspaper.
The structure is very similar
when a news story is viewed
online (although it may also
feature audio or video). This is
illustrated on the right with a
copy of a newspaper alongside
the corresponding article on its
website.
Now think about a very different
type of document — an
insurance form. Insurance forms
often have headings for different
sections, and each section
contains a list of questions with
areas for you to fill in details or
checkboxes to tick. Again, the
structure is very similar online.

# Process & Design
## Who is the Site For?
Every website should be designed for the
target audience—not just for yourself or the
site owner. It is therefore very important to
understand who your target audience is

### Target Audience: individuals
● What is the age range of your target audience?
● Will your site appeal to more women or men? What is the mix?
● Which country do your visitors live in?
● Do they live in urban or rural areas?
● What is the average income of visitors?
● What level of education do they have?
● What is their marital or family status?
● What is their occupation?
● How many hours do they work per week?
● How often do they use the web?
● What kind of device do they use to access the web?
Target Audience: Companies
● What is the size of the company or relevant department?
● What is the position of people in the company who visit your site?
● Will visitors be using the site for themselves or for someone else?
● How large is the budget they control?

## Why People Visit YOUR Website
Now that you know who your visitors are, you
need to consider why they are coming. While
some people will simply chance across your
website, most will visit for a specific reason.
## What Your Visitors areTrying to Achieve
It is unlikely that you will be able to list every
reason why someone visits your site but you
are looking for key tasks and motivations. This
information can help guide your site designs.
