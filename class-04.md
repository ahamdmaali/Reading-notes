# LINKS
### Links are the defining feature of the web because they allow you to move from one web page to another â€” enabling the very idea of browsing or surfing.
## Types of links:
1. Links from one website to another.
2. Links from one part of a web page to another part of the same page.
3. Links from one page to another on the same website.
4. Links that open in a new browser window.
5. Links that start up your email program and address a new email to someone.
  
#### to learn more about the links raed the Duckett HTML book, ch4.

# LAYOUT
### Controlling the Position of Elements:
##### CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolut positioning. You specify the positioning scheme using the position property in CSS. You can also float elements using the float property.
1. Normal flow : Every block-level element appears on a new line, causing each item to appear lower down the page than the previous one. Even if you specify the width of the boxes and there is space for two elements to sit side-byside, they will not appear next to each other. This is the default behavior (unless you tell the browser to do something else).
2. 2. Relative Positioning : This moves an element from the position it would be in normal flow, shifting it to the top, right,bottom, or left of where it would have been placed. This does not affect the position of surrounding elements; they stay in the position they would be in in normal flow.
3. Absolute positioning: This positions the element in relation to its containing element. It is taken out of normal flow, meaning that it does not affect the position of any surrounding elements (as they simply ignore the space it would have taken up). Absolutely positioned elements move as users scroll up and down the page.

## Liquid Layouts:
#### Liquid layout designs stretch and contract as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window. They tend to use percentages.
    
## CSS Frameworks:
#### CSS frameworks aim to make your life easier by providing the code for common tasks, such as creating layout grids, styling forms, creating printer-friendly versions of pages and so on. You can include the CSS framework code in your projects rather than writing the CSS from scratch.

# Functions, Methods, and Objects 
### FUNCTIONS & OBJECTS BUILT-IN METHODS: 
##### Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).

### OBJECTS 
##### Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object, variables and functions take on new names.
    
#### To learn more about functions and objects read Duckett JS book, ch3.
