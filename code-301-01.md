# RESPONSIVE WEB DESIGN and FLOATS

## Responsive Web Design
#### With the growth in mobile Internet usage comes the question of how to build websites suitable for all users. The industry response to this question has become responsive web design, also known as RWD.

## Responsive Overview
#### Responsive web design is the practice of building a website suitable to work on every device and every screen size, no matter how large or small, mobile or desktop. Responsive web design is focused around providing an intuitive and gratifying experience for everyone. Desktop computer and cell phone users alike all benefit from responsive websites.

## Responsive vs. Adaptive vs. Mobile

#### Responsive and adaptive web design are closely related, and often transposed as one in the same. Responsive generally means to react quickly and positively to any change, while adaptive means to be easily modified for a new purpose or situation, such as change. With responsive design websites continually and fluidly change based on different factors, such as viewport width, while adaptive websites are built to a group of preset factors. A combination of the two is ideal, providing the perfect formula for functional websites. Which term is used specifically doesn’t make a huge difference.

#### Mobile, on the other hand, generally means to build a separate website commonly on a new domain solely for mobile users. While this does occasionally have its place, it normally isn’t a great idea. Mobile websites can be extremely light but they do come with the dependencies of a new code base and browser sniffing, all of which can become an obstacle for both developers and users.

## Flexible Layouts
#### flexible layouts, is the practice of building the layout of a website with a flexible grid, capable of dynamically resizing to any width. Flexible grids are built using relative length units, most commonly percentages or em units. These relative lengths are then used to declare common grid property values such as width, margin, or padding.

## Media Queries

### Initializing Media Queries
#### There are a couple different ways to use media queries, using the @media rule inside of an existing style sheet, importing a new style sheet using the @import rule, or by linking to a separate style sheet from within the HTML document. Generally speaking it is recommend to use the @media rule inside of an existing style sheet to avoid any additional HTTP requests.
#### CSS formula
```
/* @media Rule */
@media all and (max-width: 1024px) {...}

/* @import Rule */
@import url(styles.css) all and (max-width: 1024px) {...}

```

### Logical Operators in Media Queries
#### Logical operators in media queries help build powerful expressions. There are three different logical operators available for use within media queries, including and, not, and only.

#### Using the and logical operator within a media query allows an extra condition to be added, making sure that a browser or devices does both a, b, c, and so forth. Multiple individual media queries can be comma separated, acting as an unspoken or operator.

## Mobile First

#### One popular technique with using media queries is called mobile first. The mobile first approach includes using styles targeted at smaller viewports as the default styles for a website, then use media queries to add styles as the viewport grows.

#### The operating belief behind mobile first design is that a user on a mobile device, commonly using a smaller viewport, shouldn’t have to load the styles for a desktop computer only to have them over written with mobile styles later. Doing so is a waste of bandwidth. Bandwidth that is precious to any users looking for a snappy website.

#### The mobile first approach also advocates designing with the constraints of a mobile user in mind. Before too long, the majority of Internet consumption will be done on a mobile device. Plan for them accordingly and develop intrinsic mobile experiences.

```
/* Default styles first then media queries */
@media screen and (min-width: 400px)  {...}
@media screen and (min-width: 600px)  {...}
@media screen and (min-width: 1000px) {...}
@media screen and (min-width: 1400px) {...}

```

## Viewport

#### Mobile devices generally do a pretty decent job of displaying websites these days. Sometimes they could use a little assistance though, particularly around identifying the viewport size, scale, and resolution of a website.

## Flexible Media
#### As viewports begin to change size media doesn’t always follow suit. Images, videos, and other media types need to be scalable, changing their size as the size of the viewport changes.

#### One quick way to make media scalable is by using the max-width property with a value of 100%. Doing so ensures that as the viewport gets smaller any media will scale down according to its containers width.

```
img, video, canvas {
  max-width: 100%;
}
```
# Floats

#### Float is a CSS positioning property. To understand its purpose and origin, we can look to print design. In a print layout, images may be set into the page such that text wraps around them as needed. This is commonly and appropriately called “text wrap”. Here is an example of that.

## What are floats used for?
#### floats can be used to create entire web layouts.

## Clearing the Float
#### Float’s sister property is clear. An element that has the clear property set on it will not move up adjacent to the float like the float desires, but will move itself down past the float. Again an illustration probably does more good than words do.

#### Clear has four valid values as well. Both is most commonly used, which clears floats coming from either direction. Left and Right can be used to only clear the float from one direction respectively. None is the default, which is typically unnecessary unless removing a clear value from a cascade. Inherit would be the fifth, but is strangely not supported in Internet Explorer. Clearing only the left or right float, while less commonly seen in the wild, definitely has its uses.

## The Great Collapse

#### One of the more bewildering things about working with floats is how they can affect the element that contains them (their “parent” element). If this parent element contained nothing but floated elements, the height of it would literally collapse to nothing. This isn’t always obvious if the parent doesn’t contain any visually noticeable background, but it is important to be aware of.

## Context
#### A block level element is as wide as the parent it’s inside (width: auto;). We can think of it as 100% wide. The wrapper for a grid probably don’t have much to do with semantics, it’s just a generic wrapper, so a div is fine.

```
<div class="grid">
  <!-- 100% wide -->
</div>
```

## Columns
#### Let’s start with a practical and common need: a main content area being 2/3 the width and a sidebar being 1/3 the width. We just make two column divs with appropriate class names.
```
<div class="grid">
  <div class="col-2-3">
     Main Content
  </div>
  <div class="col-1-3">
     Sidebar
  </div>
</div>
```
## Clearing Context
#### The parent element will collapse to zero height since it has only floated children. Let’s fix that by clearing it
```.grid:after {
  content: "";
  display: table;
  clear: both;
}
```
## Gutters
#### The hardest part about grids is gutters. So far we’ve made our grid flexible by using percentages for widths. We could make the math all complicated and use percentages for gutters as well, but personally I don’t like percentage gutters anyway, I like fixed pixel size gutters. Plus, we’re trying to keep too much thinking out of this.

1. The first step toward this is using box-sizing: border-box;. I like using it on absolutely everything.
```
*, *:after, *:before {
  -webkit-box-sizing: border-box;
  -moz-box-sizing: border-box;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

2. The second step is applying a fixed padding to the right side of all columns except the last one.
```
[class*='col-'] {
  padding-right: 20px;
}
[class*='col-']:last-of-type {
  padding-right: 0;
}
```
