# Images
### There are several things to consider when selecting and preparing images for your site: 
1. clude an image in your web pages using HTML
2. Show an image at the right size
3. Optimize an image for use on the web to make pages load faster
4. Pick which image format to use

#### Images should: 
1. Be relevant and instantly recognisable
2. Convey information and the right mood
3. Fit the color palette

### How to add images to the website:
write the following tag in the body of html file

    <img src="image source or path" alt="image description" />    

### Three Rules for Creating Images:
1. Save images in the right format
2. Save images at the right size
3. Use the correct resolution
#### Note: Use JPEG format for all images that contain a natural scene or photograph where variation in colour and intensity is smooth. Use PNG format for any image that needs transparency or for images with text & objects with sharp contrast edges like logos. Use GIF format for images that contain animations

# Color
### Colors are displayed combining RED, GREEN, and BLUE light.
## With CSS, colors can be specified in different ways:
1. By color names
2. As RGB values
3. As hexadecimal values
4. As HSL values (CSS3)
5. As HWB values (CSS4)
6. With the currentcolor keyword

##### You can find any color you want in the color picker at the following link:

# TEXT 
## The properties that allow you to control the appearance of text can be split into two groups:
1. Those that directly affect the font and its appearance (including the typeface, whether it is regular, bold or italic, and the size of the text)
2. Those that would have the same effect on text no matter what font you were using (including the color of text and the spacing between words and letters)

### Typeface Terminology 
* Serif
Serif fonts have extra details on the ends of the main strokes of the letters. These details are known as serifs.
* Sans-Serif
Sans-serif fonts have straight ends to letters, and therefore have a much cleaner design.
* Monospace 
Every letter in a monospace (or fixed-width) font is the same width. (Non-monospace fonts have different widths.)
