# LISTS 
### HTML provides us with three different types of lists:
1. Ordered lists are lists where each item in the list is numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract where each point needs to be identified by a section number.
2. Unordered lists are lists that begin with a bullet point (rather than characters that indicate order).
3. Definition lists are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms.

# BOXES
1. CSS treats each HTML element as if it has its own box.
2. You can use CSS to control the dimensions of a box.
3. You can also control the borders, margin and padding for each box with CSS.
4. It is possible to hide elements using the display and visibility properties.
5. Block-level boxes can be made into inline boxes, and inline boxes made into block-level boxes.
6. Legibility can be improved by controlling the width ofboxes containing text and the leading.
7. CSS3 has introduced the ability to create image borders and rounded borders.

# ARRAYS 
#### An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values.
### CREATING AN ARRAY:
###### You create an array and give it a name just like you would any other variable (using the var keyword followed by the name of the array).
###### On JS write :
var colors =new Array('white ' ,'black','custom');
var el = document.getElementByid( ' colors' );
el.innerHTML = colors.item(O); 

# Decisions and Loops
##### SWITCH STATEMENTS
###### The purpose of the switch statement is to present the user with a different message depending on which level they are at.
### LOOPS
##### Types of loops
1. For loop : A for loop is often used to loop through the items in an array. 
2. while loop: This loop will continue to run for as long as the condition in the parentheses is true.
3. Do while loop: The key difference between a whi 1 e loop and a do whi 1 e loop is that the statements in the code block come before the condition. This means that those statements are run once whether or not the condition is met.
