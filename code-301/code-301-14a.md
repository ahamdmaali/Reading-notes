# Database Normalization

#### Database normalization is a process used to organize a database into tables and columns.  The main idea with this is that a table should be about a specific topic and only supporting topics included.

## Reasons for Database Normalization
1. minimize duplicate data
2. minimize or avoid data modification issues
3. to simplify queries

## Data Duplication and Modification Anomalies
### Duplicated information presents two problems:
  1. It increases storage and decrease performance.
  2. It becomes more difficult to maintain data changes.

## Definition of Database Normalization
#### There are three common forms of database normalization: 1st, 2nd, and 3rd normal form. They are also abbreviated as 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF respectively. 

1. ### First Normal Form: The information is stored in a relational table with each column containing atomic values. There are no repeating groups of columns.
2. ### Second Normal Form: The table is in first normal form and all the columns depend on the table’s primary key.
3. ### Third Normal Form – the table is in second normal form and all of its columns are not transitively dependent on the primary key.
