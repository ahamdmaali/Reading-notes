# EJS Partials

#### Partials come in handy when you want to reuse the same HTML across multiple views. Think of partials as functions, they make large websites easier to maintain as you don’t have to go and change a piece of text in every page it appears in. Instead, you define that reusable bundle of code in a file andinclude it wherever you need it.

### As you can see from the screenshots below, the same navigation bar and footer appear in both the home and post view. This makes them perfect candidates for partials!

##  Creating  partials
1. Create a file called **navbar.ejs** : which will contain only the HTML for the navigation bar at the top of the home.
    ```
     <!-- views/partials/navbar.ejs -->
      <div class="header clearfix">
         <nav>
            <ul class="nav nav-pills pull-right">
                <li role="presentation"><a href="/">Home</a></li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="text-muted">Node.js Blog</h3>
         </nav>
       </div>  ```

2.  Create a file called **footer.ejs** 
   ```
  <!-- views/partials/footer.ejs -->
    <footer class="footer">
        <p>© 90210 Lawyer Stuff.</p>
    </footer>
  
  ```


#### Now that we have our partials defined, we can use them in our home.ejs and post.ejs templates.
####  In EJS, any JavaScript or non-HTML syntax you include in your templates is always surrounded by <% %> delimiters (you could change these delimiters if you really wanted to).

### Note: The <%- %> tags allow us to output the unescaped content onto the page (notice the -). This is important when using the include() statement since you don’t want EJS to escape your HTML characters like ‘<’, ‘>’.

```
  <body>
        <div class="container">
            <%- include('partials/navbar') %>
            <div class="jumbotron">
                <h1>All about Node</h1>
                <p class="lead">Check out our articles below!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-lg-12">
                    <div class="list-group">
                      <!-- loop over blog posts and render them -->
                      LIST_OF_POSTS
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <%- include('partials/footer') %>
        </div>
    </body>
```
