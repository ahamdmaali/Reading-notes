# MUSTACHE and FLEXBOX

## Javascript Templating
#### Javascript templating is a fast and efficient technique to render client-side view templates with Javascript by using a JSON data source. The template is HTML markup, with added templating tags that will either insert variables or run programming logic.The template engine then replaces variables and instances declared in a template file with actual values at runtime, and convert the template into an HTML file sent to the client.

### Mustache
#### Mustache is a logic-less template syntax. It can be used for HTML, config files, source code — anything. It works by expanding tags in a template using values provided in a hash or object.
#### It is often referred to as “logic-less” because there are no if statements, else clauses, or for loops. Instead, there are only tags. Some tags are replaced with a value, some nothing, and others a series of values.
#### mustache.js is an implementation of the mustache template system in JavaScript. It is often considered the base for JavaScript templating. And, since mustache supports various languages, we don’t need a separate templating system on the server side.
```
Mustache.render(“Hello, {{name}}”, { name: “Sherlynn” });
  // returns: Hello, Sherlynn
```
### Mustache-Express
```
var nameObject = {"name": "Sherlynn"}
res.render('hello', nameObject)
```
#### The output is:

##  Flexbox

#### The main idea behind the flex layout is to give the container the ability to alter its items’ width/height (and order) to best fill the available space (mostly to accommodate to all kind of display devices and screen sizes). A flex container expands items to fill available free space or shrinks them to prevent overflow.

### Flexbox properties
1. display
2. order
3. flex-direction
4. flex-grow
5. flex-wrap
6. flex-shrink
7. flex-basis
8. flex-flow

### Prefixing Flexbox
#### Flexbox requires some vendor prefixing to support the most browsers possible. It doesn’t just include prepending properties with the vendor prefix, but there are actually entirely different property and value names. This is because the Flexbox spec has changed over time.
