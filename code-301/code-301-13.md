# SENDING FORM DATA

#### Once the form data has been validated on the client-side, it is okay to submit the form. And, since we covered validation in the previous article, we're ready to submit! This article looks at what happens when a user submits a form — where does the data go, and how do we handle it when it gets there? We also look at some of the security concerns associated with sending form data.

## Client/server architecture
#### the web uses a client/server architecture that can be summarized as follows. a client (usually a web browser) sends a request to a server (most of the time a web server like Apache, Nginx, IIS, Tomcat, etc.), using the HTTP protocol. The server answers the request using the same protocol.

## On the client side: defining how to send the data
#### The <form> element defines how the data will be sent. All of its attributes are designed to let you configure the request to be sent when a user hits a submit button. The two most important attributes are action and method.
### The action attribute
#### The action attribute defines where the data gets sent. Its value must be a valid relative or absolute URL. If this attribute isn't provided, the data will be sent to the URL of the page containing the form — the current page.

### The method attribute
#### The method attribute defines how data is sent. The HTTP protocol provides several ways to perform a request; HTML form data can be transmitted via a number of different methods, the most common being the GET method and the POST method.

1. ### The GET method
       #### The GET method is the method used by the browser to ask the server to send back a given resource: "Hey server,  I want to get this resource." In this case, the browser sends an empty body. Because the body is empty, if a form is sent using this method the data sent to the server is appended to the URL.
2. ### The POST method
       #### The POST method is a little different. It's the method the browser uses to talk to the server when asking for a response that takes into account the data provided in the body of the HTTP request: "Hey server, take a look at this data and send me back an appropriate result." If a form is sent using this method, the data is appended to the body of the HTTP request.

### Viewing HTTP requests
#### HTTP requests are never displayed to the user (if you want to see them, you need to use tools such as the Firefox Network Monitor or the Chrome Developer Tools). As an example, your form data will be shown as follows in the Chrome Network tab. After submitting the form:
1. Open the developer tools.
2. Select "Network"
3. Select "All"
4. Select "foo.com" in the "Name" tab
5. Select "Headers"   

## A special case: sending files
#### Sending files with HTML forms is a special case. Files are binary data — or considered as such — whereas all other data is text data. Because HTTP is a text protocol, there are special requirements for handling binary data.

### The enctype attribute
#### This attribute lets you specify the value of the Content-Type HTTP header included in the request generated when the form is submitted. This header is very important because it tells the server what kind of data is being sent. By default, its value is application/x-www-form-urlencoded. In human terms, this means: "This is form data that has been encoded into URL parameters."

## Security issues
#### Each time you send data to a server, you need to consider security. HTML forms are by far the most common server attack vectors (places where attacks can occur). The problems never come from the HTML forms themselves — they come from how the server handles data.
### Be paranoid: Never trust your users
#### All data that comes to your server must be checked and sanitized. Always. No exception.
1. ### Escape potentially dangerous characters.
       #### The specific characters you should be cautious with vary depending on the context in which the data is used and the server platform you employ, but all server-side languages have functions for this. Things to watch out for are character sequences that look like executable code (such as JavaScript or SQL commands).

2. ### Limit the incoming amount of data to allow only what's necessary.
3. ### Sandbox uploaded files
       #### Store them on a different server and allow access to the file only through a different subdomain or even better through a completely different domain.
