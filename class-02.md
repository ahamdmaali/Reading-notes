# TEXT 
## In this Topic we focus on how to add markup to the text that appears on your pages. You will learn about:
1. Structural markup: the elements that you can use to
describe both headings and paragraphs.
2. Semantic markup: which provides extra information; such
as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something
you have written is a quotation (and who said it), the
meaning of acronyms

## Headings
1. <h1>This is a Main Heading</h1>
2. <h2>This is a Level 2 Heading</h2>
3. <h3>This is a Level 3 Heading</h3>
4. <h4>This is a Level 4 Heading</h4>
5. <h5>This is a Level 5 Heading</h5>
6. <h6>This is a Level 6 Heading</h6>
### Head numbred from 1 to 6 in order how the head is important
#### so h1 is most important head while h6 is the least.
# Paragraphs
## "<p>text</p>"
#### A paragraph consists of one or more sentences that form a self-contained unit of discourse. The start of a paragraph is indicated by a new line.
# Superscript and Subscrip 
## Superscript : The  element is used to contain characters that should be superscript such as the suffixes of dates or mathematical concepts like raising a number to a power.
## Subscript : The  element is used to contain characters that should be subscript. It is commonly used with foot notes or chemical formulas.
# White Space 
### In order to make code easier to read, web page authors often add extra spaces or start some elements on new lines. When the browser comes across two or more spaces next to each other, it only displays one space. Similarly if it comes across a line break, it treats that as a single space too. This is known as white space collapsing.
# Semantic Markup 
### There are some text elements that are not intended to affect the structure of your web pages, but they do add extra information to the pages â€” they are known as semantic markup.

# Introducing CSS 
### CSS allows you to create rules that specify how the content of an element should appear. For example, you can specify that the background of the page is cream, all paragraphs should appear in gray using the Arial typeface, or that all level one headings should be in a blue, italic, Times typeface.
## The key to understanding how CSS works is to imagine that there is an invisible box around every HTML element.
## CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.
#### Selectors indicate which element the rule applies to. The same rule can apply to more than one element if you separate the element names with commas.
#### Declarations indicate how the elements referred to in the selector should be styled. Declarations are split into twoparts (a property and a value), and are separated by a colon.
## CSS Selectors : There are many different types of CSS selector that allow you to target rules to specific elements in an HTML document.
